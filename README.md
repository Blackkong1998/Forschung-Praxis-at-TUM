Numerical Discretization in High Accuracy MPC Applications
## Abstract
This work provides a comparative review of numerical methods generally used to discretize continuous-time linear
system models appearing in Model Predictive Control (MPC)
problems, i.e., Runge-Kutta (RK) methods and Gauss collocation.
An overview of the characteristics of different RK methods, i.e.
RK1, RK2, RK4, are given and the performance of each method
is evaluated in a simulation example. Furthermore, we provide a
discretization method based on Gauss collocation that allows to
consider piecewise polynomial input functions within MPC, akin
to higher-order hold elements.
