%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Document %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{abstract}
This work provides a comparative review of numerical methods generally used to discretize continuous-time linear system models appearing in Model Predictive Control (MPC) problems, i.e., Runge-Kutta (RK) methods and Gauss collocation. An overview of the characteristics of different RK methods, i.e. RK1, RK2, RK4, are given and the performance of each method is evaluated in a simulation example. Furthermore, we provide a discretization method based on Gauss collocation that allows to consider piecewise polynomial input functions within MPC, akin to higher-order hold elements.
